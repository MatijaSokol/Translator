# Translator
**Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)** is a SDK designed to simplify creating cross-platform mobile applications. With the help of KMM, you can share common code between iOS and Android apps and write platform-specific code only where itâ€™s necessary. For example, to implement a native UI or when working with platform-specific APIs.

Translator is a sample KMM project which include a module with shared code on iOS and Android. Since this project is built on a Windows machine, only Android part is fully made. iOS part can access shared code, but UI is missing (only available on Mac).

This project is made using tutorial provided [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLeNI0__gDs).
